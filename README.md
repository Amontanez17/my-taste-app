### Why I chose this app:
As a lover of music and film, I decided to create a web app that allows you to pick your favorite movies and then based on your selection recommends podcasts, music, and even other movies.

Sometimes we just want an algorithm to pick our next favorite artist, film, or podcast for us. There are so many choices out there!

This was my first React JS project at the Ironhack Full-Stack Web Development program.

### Key Implementations:
* Programmed with React JS, CSS, HTML.
* Functional programming with a mock backend, data scraping from an open source api, and get requests to a secondary api.

### Key Features:
* My first CRUD project.
* **Display data:** Thousands of movies to select from thanks to scraping the TMDB database to retrieve their movies and display them on tmy web app.
* 
* A search bar to search through the database.

* **Like and save:** The ability to manipulate the data set by adding and removing favorites and then displaying them on a dedicated page.

* These can be edited from any page!

* **Request: ** Based on your selection, you can send a request to the Tastedive API to get movie, music, or podcast recommendations giving you a curated media experience!

### What's Next:
* **Push the design:** Given the time constraints, I did not get to experiment with the design and ui as much as I would have loved to but that’s okay!

* **Add local storage/users:**Being able to store your favorites and recs and link them to a user account.

* **Incorporate Spotify API:** There is a Spotify API that let’s premium users integrate the app in their own web apps and create playlists.

* **Open AI:** Why not integrate Open Ai in order to get more personalized recommendations and rank your suggestions by popularity

### THANK YOU!
